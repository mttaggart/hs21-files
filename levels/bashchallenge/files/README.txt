A service on this machine expects the correct username and password to login. You have a list of usernames and passwords to test, but this lists are too long to attempt manually. The service runs on network port 9999 and expects to receive credentials in the form of `username:password`.

Write a bash script to "brute force" every username/password combination to find the correct one.

To start the service, first run `/opt/bashchallengesvc &`
