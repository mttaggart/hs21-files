=== COMMAND CHALLENGE ===

In this challenge, you have to find the pieces of the flag and put them together into a single file. For the sake of ease, we will use `>>` to put the flag pieces on separate lines in the file `flag.txt`, which you need to create. Inside the `parts/` folder are several files that may contain parts of the flag. You'll have to use the tools you have learned so far to discover the flag parts and put them together in order.
